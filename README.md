# LocalLibrary MDN Tutorial

This project is walking through using Express-Generator to set up a simple
Express web app that shows the different capabilities of Express that can scale
to make larger and more complicated apps. I will be updating the ReadMe as I
work through it to note what I have learned. I will also be attempting all of
the extra credit assignments that are apart of the tutorial to test myself.

# Part 1

Used express-generator to build a skeleton of an Express app. Walked through
each part of app.js to see what's going on, as well as the bonus of setting up a
test route to /users/cool to display "you're so cool" on the browser from the
response.
